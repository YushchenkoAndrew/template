# Template project

### This repository has a long story!

When I created this repo it was like a toy project where I would put my realization of interesting algorithms in which I would run into thorough browsing the internet. I created those projects using p5js library, that was easy to use and it was the main criteria. After a certain amount of projects I faced a problem with loading additional files, so I was forced to create a simple Back-End Server for sending those files. I choose NodeJS and Express, because it has a big community behind and a lot of examples. A few days later I started build one of my sides project which was a RaspberryPi Cluster. I tried two ways of realization this goal. First is using MPI and creating a Parallel program which was started on each Node. Second is installing a Kubernetes. So after creating own cluster on Kubernetes the first thought that I had is "I can host for my website that I built!". At that moment my Website was a poor design, what should I tell, "It doesn't have the navigation page, Karl!!!". After that I started to improve this project, add some additional features, creating a "normal" UI and improving Back-End part. During my journey I faced some ups and downs, learned a lot of things and will learn in a future. You know it's fanny to realize that a toy project became one of my biggest project which I proud of!
